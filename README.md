## Description
This is my first full stack application, where I developed the backend using sequelize to create databases, and routes. Then I used handlebars to make the front end HTML templates.  

It was challenging to keep track of so many folders and files, but all came together in the end!  I am still having issues with trying to reset the login and signup forms, but nothing seems to fix it.

Here is a preview of the website:
